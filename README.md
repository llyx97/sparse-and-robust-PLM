# A Win-win Deal: Towards Sparse and Robust Pre-trained Language Models

This repository contains implementation of the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11218) "A Win-win Deal: Towards Sparse and Robust Pre-trained Language Models" (accepted by NeruIPS 2022).

## Overview
The main topic of this paper is to investigate **whether there exist PLM subnetworks that are both sparse and robust against dataset bias?**
